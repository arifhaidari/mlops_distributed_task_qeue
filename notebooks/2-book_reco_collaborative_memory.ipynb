    "Collaborative filtering: memory approach ¶\n",
    "Collaborative filtering has quickly become one of the most used techniques in the construction of recommendation systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The site Amazon, whose initial activity only concerned the sale of books online, popularized this method with its service \"People who liked this book also liked this book\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaborative filtering consists of providing recommendations by exclusively exploiting past interactions in users and products, by grouping and identifying groups of users or products whose interactions are similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "More precisely, collaborative filtering uses a rating matrix whose rows correspond to users and columns to elements. Thus, the cell (u, i) of the matrix corresponds either to the score given by the user u to the product i or to an empty box if the user has not had any interaction with the product.\n",
    "\n",
    "This score associated with a user and a product can be collected in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "Explicit: the user assigns ratings to the products tested or explicitly indicates their preferences (likes/dislikes)\n",
    "Implicit: the score is calculated based on the user's interactions with this product (seen, put in the basket, purchased, duration on the page, etc.)\n",
    "The goal of collaborative filtering is to predict the score that a user would give to a product with which they have not yet tested. Thus, the better the prediction, the more relevant the product will be to recommend to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "The collaborative filtering technique can be implemented using two approaches that we will explore: the memory approach and the model approach."
